Use the following steps to help you progress through the exercise (use your best judgment, these are not precise steps):

* Connect with your mentor and figure out the best way to pair with other software engineers on your team
* Schedule some pairing sessions
* Pair with the other software engineers
* Share the results with your mentor



Questions
Use these questions to guide your curiosity during the exercise:

What did you learn when pairing?
* I learned that the concept that people have different preferences when it comes to pair programming is a very real thing.
** My umbrella project partner had really no experience with React Testing, so he let me run the wheel a bit more than him.
* While the problem did get solved slowly (because we are both rather inexperienced with React Testing and jest), it would have been solved much slower had I been doing it on my own.




What pairing techniques did you use?
* We used the driver-navigator pattern.
* I drove in the first meeting, and he drove (mostly) in the second meeting.





How would you pair with others in the future?
* Maybe in pair programming, try to pick something we're both about as experienced in next time. Maybe?
* But it was still very helpful even though there was an experience gap.
