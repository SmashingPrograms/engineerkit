I believe the principles of craftsmanship can be applied in any trade. In this article, I will be giving examples of the way craftsmanship, learning through experience, can be applied to several different jobs.

My step grandfather was a truck driver. In order to drive, you have to get certified, which can take up to 6 months. You often will work as a short haul driver until you are experienced enough to move up in the industry, into long-haul driving, which pays significantly more.

In the United States, to be a teacher, you need to be accredited by the state, which requires a 4-year bachelor's degree. In the time you get that degree, you are required to spend time as a student teacher, where you are essentially an intern for an experienced teacher. This is intended to build hands-on experience in the trade. Once done with the degree, you start your years teaching at a low salary, but will build up your income as you teach for more years. Teachers will often get master's degrees on the side in order to get a raise at the school.

In software development, you start off in some kind of training, whether it be self-teaching, going to a coding camp, or going to a 4-year university. You gain some general experience. Then, when hired to your first job, you may start as an apprentice or intern. You will then become a junior full-time developer. Once you work in the industry for a few years, you can become an intermediate or even senior developer very quickly.
