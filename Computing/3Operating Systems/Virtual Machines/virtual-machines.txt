What is an OS? Same as question 1 on Operating Systems





What is a VM?
* Virtual machine: "A software emulation of a computer that runs in an isolated partition of a real computer."
* There are many reasons it can be useful:
** Brings down cost
** To be able to run programs that may otherwise not be able to be run on the main operating system
** Security purposes
** Increase efficiency and productivity (less servers)
** DevOps - If you need to do something to the 




What is an .iso file?
* A disk image of an ISO 9660 file system (such as a CD or DVD); also used as the file extension for such a file.
* In this case, it is used to hold the file of the OS data.
* I was able to download that online in this case. The disc generally holds it and that's what you put into your system, but 




How much memory did you allocate to the virtual machine?
* 20 GB (I picked a random number, no particular reason to be honest.)
* Actually 2.00 MB on the real disk.
* dynamically allocated storage - actually means it "will initially be very small and not occupy any space for unused virtual disk sectors, but will grow every time a disk sector is written to for the first time, until the drive reaches the maximum capacity chosen when the drive was created."





--Cutoff--

* Tech lead
* 4 developers
* QA
* Scrum master
* TRA - Technical Requirements Analyst
* Dedicated UI/UX is missing at BAH

* Most companies have design patterns
* Not entirely certain on how that is run.

BID and BDMS don't have dedicated UX people

But I have worked on teams that have a person on the team who is a designer.

They'll be in a main design team BUT in separate projects.

We are a service-based team.

Projects have levels of confidentiality so this may be hard to do.

Deliverable - what you owe someone. Your deliverable is the code that does everything that is being asked of you.


* Start with my project
** 1. Are there any designers on the team I could talk to?
* I could talk to a friend mine.
* Ask her to take this out of our list.

* Mentor can try to track something down.
* Mentor would like me to first try and explore this on my own.




1. Understand what paired programming is.
2. Get the support from your team and finding a partner that wants to do that as well.
3. Ask every single member on my team, to see if someone wanted to pair program, to genuinely work on something.



* Look into OneNote


* Data set is so large, we don't have a good way to search through it and find what we need without too much data


Talk to Emily about:
* Get into the repository with the pipeline we're gonna be working on
* Look into CMIP6

* There's not a specific designer
* She could check the roster
* Infrastructure technology lead
* POCs for different portions?
* Specifically a graphic designer? I don't think so.

* ARM is a newer spec for CPU architecture



* Go to time.bah.com
* Write critiques
* Share with mentor
* That should be enough
